This version leverages OpenAI API for language model (`gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`) and FAISS for similarity search with OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-3-large`). You can replace these models easily with other OpenAI models by defining them as environment variables. \n",

    "* Processed documents are stored in JSON format within the project, not in the external database to not add additional dependency to project;\n",
    "* Chatbot stores chat history in-memory and not in the database. So, the chatbot remembers only messages from the current session. It can be easily changed by leveraging [LangChain integrations with DBs](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/memory/);\n",

    "There two main components of the system: RAG and chatbot. RAG is a FAISS index storing in-memory embeddings of documents. When the user asks question, the question is used as a prompt to retrieve few relevant (default 4) documents from the index. To create an index several text processing steps were made: text was divided to articles, some redundant and repeating elements were removed, finally each article was processed by chunking on max length of 1000 characters and 100 characters overlap. Afterwards obtained documents were vectorized using `text-embedding-3-large` embedder from OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chatbot is implemented using LangChain and has a pretty basic logic. It receives user's message, asks RAG for several relevant documents, checks whether the documents are relevant to a question. If they are, than responds the question based on information available, if not, than just responds \"I don't know\". Chatbot stores interaction history, so remembers all the historical messages within session.\n",
