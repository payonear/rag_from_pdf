This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of\npersonal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.\n\n2. This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the\nprotection of personal data.\n\n3. The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons\nconnected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR)\nThe latest consolidated version of the Regulation with corrections by Corrigendum, OJ L 127, 23.5.2018, p. 2\n((EU) 2016/679). Source: EUR-lex.Related information Article 1. Subject-matter and objectives\n\nRecitals\n\n(1) The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article 8(1)\nof the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \u2018Charter\u2019) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data\nconcerning him or her.\n\n(2) The principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal\ndata should, whatever their nationality or residence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their\nright to the protection of personal data. This Regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of\nfreedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening and the\nconvergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural persons.\n\n(3) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [4] seeks to harmonise the protection of\nfundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow of\npersonal data between Member States.\n\n[4] Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of\nindividuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281,\n23.11.1995, p. 31). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1995:281:TOC\n\n(4) The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal data\nis not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other\n\nfundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental\nrights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the Treaties, in particular\nthe respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of\nthought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to conduct a business, the right to\nan effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.\n\n(5) The economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial\nincrease in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors,\nincluding natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in theMember States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to\nperform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.\n\n(6) Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal\ndata. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both\nprivate companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue\ntheir activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology\nhas transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within\nthe Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring a high level of the\nprotection of personal data.\n\n(7) Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by\nstrong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across\nthe internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical certainty for\nnatural persons, economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced.\n\n(8) Where this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States\nmay, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to\nwhom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law.\n\n(9) The objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the\n\nimplementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are\nsignificant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. Differences in the\nlevel of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal\ndata, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the free flow of personal data\nthroughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at\nthe level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under\nUnion law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and\napplication of Directive 95/46/EC.\n\n(10) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to\nflows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with\nregard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous\napplication of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to\nthe processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the processing of personal data\nfor compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the\nexercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce\nnational provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this Regulation. In conjunction with the generaland horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific\nlaws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member\nStates to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (\u2018sensitive data\u2019). To that\nextent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing\nsituations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.\n\n(11) Effective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of\nthe rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data, as\nwell as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data\nand equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States.\n\n(12) Article 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the\nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free\nmovement of personal data.\n\n(13) In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent\ndivergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to\nprovide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized\nenterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and\nobligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of\n\npersonal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory\nauthorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free\nmovement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection\nof natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro,\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250\nemployees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their\nsupervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized\nenterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should\ndraw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC [5].\n\n[5] Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-\nL\nenterprises\ncontent/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2003:124:TOC\n\n20.5.2003,\n\n(C(2003)\n\n1422)\n\n124,\n\n36).\n\n(OJ\n\np."}, {"article_number": 2, "article_summary": "Material scope: Specifies the data processing activities that fall under the GDPR, including processing in the context of EU member states' activities, regardless of whether the processing occurs in the EU or not.\n", "article_text": "1.

This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data\n\nprocessed by public authorities under this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union\n\nlegal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council [7]. Member States may entrust competent\n\nauthorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the\n\nprevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the\n\nsafeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in\nso far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation.\n\nWith regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this Regulation,Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this\n\nRegulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those\n\ncompetent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of\n\nthe respective Member State. When the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this\n\nRegulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and\n\nrights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific\n\nimportant interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the\n\nexecution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.

Territorial scope\n\nRecitals\n\n(22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor\nin the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself\ntakes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable\narrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal\npersonality, is not the determining factor in that respect.\n\n(23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this\nRegulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not\nestablished in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering\ngoods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether\nsuch a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be\nascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one\nor more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an\nintermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally\nused in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as\nthe use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering\ngoods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it\napparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union.\n\n(24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not\nestablished in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour\nof such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a\nprocessing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether\nnatural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques\nwhich consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for\nanalysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\n\n(25) Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a\ncontroller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State\u2019s diplomatic mission or consular post.Documents\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nWP29, Update of Opinion on applicable law in light of the CJEU judgement in Google Spain (2010).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 3/2018 on the Territorial Scope of the GDPR (2019).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 05/2021 on the Interplay between the application of Article 3 and the provisions on international\ntransfers as per Chapter V of the GDPR (2021).\n\nCase Law\n\nCJEU, Pammer and Hotel Alpenhof GesmbH/Reederei Karl Schl\u00fcter GmbH & Co.

This is due to various reasons:\n\ni) behavioural advertising normally involves the collection of IP addresses and the processing of unique identifiers (through\n\nthe cookie). The use of such devices with a unique identifier allows the tracking of users of a specific computer even when\n\ndynamic IP addresses are used. In other words, such devices enable data subjects to be \u2018singled out\u2019, even if their real\n\nnames are not known.\n\nii) Furthermore, the information collected in the context of behavioural advertising relates to, (i.e. is about) a person\u2019s\n\ncharacteristics or behaviour and it is used to influence that particular person. This view is further confirmed if one takes\n\ninto account the possibility for profiles to be linked at any moment with directly identifiable information provided by the data\n\nsubject, such as registration related information.\n\nDPC (Ireland), Guidance for Organisations Accidentally in Receipt of Personal Data (2020):\n\nAn organisation, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, must be aware of the possibility of finding itself\n\naccidentally in possession of personal data.

It is often used to make predictions about people,\n\nusing data from various sources to infer something about an individual, based on the qualities of others who appear\n\nstatistically similar.\n\nThe GDPR says that profiling is automated processing of personal data for evaluating personal aspects, in particular to analyse\n\nor make predictions about individuals. The use of the word \u2018evaluating\u2019 suggests that profiling involves some form of\n\nassessment or judgement about a person.\n\nA simple classification of individuals based on known characteristics such as their age, sex, and height does not necessarily\n\nlead to profiling. This will depend on the purpose of the classification. For instance, a business may wish to classify its\n\ncustomers according to their age or gender for statistical purposes and to acquire an aggregated overview of its clients without\n\nmaking any predictions or drawing any conclusion about an individual. In this case, the purpose is not assessing individual\n\ncharacteristics and is therefore not profiling.\n\nThe GDPR is inspired by but is not identical to the definition of profiling in the Council of Europe Recommendation CM/Rec\n\n(2010)132 (the Recommendation), as the Recommendation excludes processing that does not include inference. Neverthelessthe Recommendation usefully explains that profiling may involve three distinct stages:\n\ndata collection;\n\nautomated analysis to identify correlations;\n\napplying the correlation to an individual to identify characteristics of present or future behaviour.\n\nControllers carrying out profiling will need to ensure they meet the GDPR requirements in respect of all of the above stages.\n\nBroadly speaking, profiling means gathering information about an individual (or group of individuals) and evaluating their\n\ncharacteristics or behaviour patterns in order to place them into a certain category or group, in particular to analyse and/or\n\nmake predictions about, for example, their:\n\nability to perform a task;\n\ninterests; or\n\nlikely behaviour.\n\n(5) \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer\nbe attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional\ninformation is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal\ndata are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;\n\nRecitals\n\n(26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person.\n\nPersonal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional\n\ninformation should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is\n\nidentifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by\n\nanother person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to\n\nidentify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for\nidentification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The\nprinciples of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an\n\nidentified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no\n\nlonger identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for\n\nstatistical or research purposes.\n\n(28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers\n\nand processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 in this Regulation is not\n\nintended to preclude any other measures of data protection. \n\n(29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymisation should,\n\nwhilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational\n\nmeasures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented, and that additional information forattributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately.

Source: EUR-lex.Related information Article 4. Definitions\n\nRecitals\n\n(26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural\nperson. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the\nuse of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine\nwhether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as\nsingling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To\nascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all\nobjective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration\nthe available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data\nprotection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an\nidentified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data\nsubject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous\ninformation, including for statistical or research purposes.\n\n(27) This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules\nregarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons.\n\n(28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and\nintroduction of\nhelp controllers and processors to meet\n\u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection.\n\ntheir data-protection obligations. The explicit\n\n(29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of\npseudonymisation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller\nhas taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this\nRegulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject\nis kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same\ncontroller.\n\n(30) Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and\nprotocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency\nidentification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other\ninformation received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.(31) Public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of\ntheir official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent administrative\nauthorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should\nnot be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the\ngeneral interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for disclosure sent by the public\nauthorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a filing system\nor lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal data by those public authorities should\ncomply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.\n\n(32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and\nunambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such\nas by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when\nvisiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or\nconduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her\npersonal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all\nprocessing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes,\nconsent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic\nmeans, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is\n\nprovided.\n\n(33) It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes\nat the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of\nscientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should\nhave the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent\nallowed by the intended purpose.\n\n(34) Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a\nnatural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular\nchromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of another\nelement enabling equivalent information to be obtained.\n\n(35) Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which\nreveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject.

Justification of thenecessity is dependent on:\n\nthe nature of the service;\n\nthe mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract;\n\nthe rationale of the contract; and\n\nthe essential elements of the contract.\n\nThe controller should be able to demonstrate how the main object of the specific contract with the data subject cannot be\n\nperformed if the specific processing of the personal data in question does not occur. Merely referencing or mentioning data\n\nprocessing in a contract is not enough to bring the processing in question within the scope of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR.\n\n(c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;\n\nRecitals\n\n(45) Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is\n\nnecessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should\n\nhave a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a\n\nbasis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary\n\nfor the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should\n\nalso be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the general\n\nconditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining the\n\ncontroller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the\n\npersonal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing. It\n\nshould also be for Union or Member State law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest\n\nor in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or,\n\nwhere it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the\n\nmanagement of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association.\n\n(d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\n\nRecitals\n\n(46) The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential\n\nfor the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital interest of another\n\nnatural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types\n\nof processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when\n\nprocessing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations ofhumanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.\n\n(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of\nofficial authority vested in the controller;\n\nRecitals\n\n(115) Some third countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly regulate the processing activities of\n\nnatural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States. This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions\n\nof administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are\n\nnot based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the\n\nUnion or a Member State. The extraterritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of\n\ninternational law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation.\n\nTransfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This may be the\n\ncase, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to\n\nwhich the controller is subject.\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nEDPB, Guidelines on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak (2020).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020).\n\n(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,\nexcept where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject\nwhich require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nRecitals\n\n(47) The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third\n\nparty, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject\n\nare not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the\n\ncontroller. Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data\n\nsubject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the\n\nexistence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time\n\nand in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and\n\nfundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processedin circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law\n\nfor the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public\n\nauthorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud\n\nalso constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes\n\nmay be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.\n\n(48) Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest in\n\ntransmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes, including the processing of clients'\n\nor employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal data, within a group of undertakings, to an\n\nundertaking located in a third country remain unaffected.\n\n(49) The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and\n\ninformation security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events\n\nor unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted\n\npersonal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities,\n\nby computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic\n\ncommunications networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the\n\ndata controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks\n\nand malicious code distribution and stopping \u2018denial of service\u2019 attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication\n\nsystems. \n\nDocuments\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nWP29, Opinion on the \u201cNotion of legitimate interests of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC\u201d (2014).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020):\n\n44. For what concerns the legitimate interest lawful basis, the EDPB recalls that in Fashion ID, the CJEU reiterated that in\n\norder for processing to rely on the legitimate interest, three cumulative conditions should be met, namely\n\nthe pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed,\n\nthe need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, and\n\nthe condition that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject whose data require protection do not take\n\nprecedence.\n\nThe CJEU also specified that in a situation of joint controllership \u201cit is necessary that each of those controllers should pursue a\n\nlegitimate interest [\u2026] through those processing operations in order for those operations to be justified in respect of each of\n\nthem\u201d.\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020).\n\nData Protection Commission (Ireland), Data Protection Considerations Relating to Receivership (2020).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 06/2020 on the interplay of the Second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR (2020).The GDPR may allow for the processing of silent party data when this processing is necessary for purposes of the legitimate\n\ninterests pursued by a controller or by a third party.\n\nA lawful basis for the processing of silent party data by PISPs and AISPs \u2013 in the context of the provision of payment services\n\nunder the PSD2 \u2013 could thus be the legitimate interest of a controller or a third party to perform the contract with the payment\n\nservice user. The necessity to process personal data of the silent party is limited and determined by the reasonable expectations\n\nof these data subjects.\n\nEffective and appropriate measures have to be established by all parties involved. In this respect, the controller has to establish\n\nthe necessary safeguards for the processing, including technical measures. If feasible, also encryption or other techniques must\n\nbe applied to achieve an appropriate level of security and data minimisation.\n\nCase Law\n\nCJEU, TK v Asocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, Case C-708/18 (2018).\n\nPoint (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance\nof their tasks.\n\nRecitals\n\n(40) In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned\n\nor some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this\n\nRegulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the\n\nperformance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to\n\nentering into a contract.\n\n(50) The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be\nallowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such a case,\nno legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the\n\nperformance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or\n\nMember State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as\n\ncompatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or\n\nstatistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or\n\nMember State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain\n\nwhether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the\n\ncontroller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any\n\nlink between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been\n\ncollected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further\n\nuse; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of\n\nappropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations.Where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and\n\nproportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, the\n\ncontroller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the\n\napplication of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes\n\nand on his or her rights including the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security\n\nby the controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or\n\nthreats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller.\n\nHowever, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if\n\nthe processing is not compatible with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy. \n\n2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this\nRegulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more\nprecisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing\nincluding for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.\n\n3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:\n\n(a) Union law; or\n\n(b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.\n\nThe purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in\npoint (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the\nexercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the\napplication of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by\nthe controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to,\nand the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and\nprocessing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as\nthose for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.

Lawfulness of processing\n\nRecitals\n\n(40) In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data\nsubject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or\nMember State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to\nwhich the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or\nin order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.\n\n(41) Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a\nlegislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the\nMember State concerned. However, such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its\napplication should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of\nthe European Union (the \u2018Court of Justice\u2019) and the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n(42) Where processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the\ndata subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on\nanother matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which\nconsent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC [10] a declaration of consent pre-formulated by\nthe controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it\nshould not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity\nof the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be\n\nregarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent\nwithout detriment.\n\n[10] Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts (OJ L 95, 21.4.1993, p.\n29). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1993:095:TOC\n\n(43) In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing\nof personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in\nparticular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the\ncircumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate\nconsent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case,\nor if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite suchconsent not being necessary for such performance.\n\n(44) Processing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a\ncontract.\n\n(45) Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where\nprocessing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official\nauthority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a\nspecific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal\nobligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried\nout in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for Union or\nMember State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the general conditions\nof this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining the\ncontroller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects concerned, the entities to\nwhich the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure\nlawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine whether the controller\nperforming a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority\nor another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is in the public interest to do so, including for\nhealth purposes such as public health and social protection and the management of health care services, by private\n\nlaw, such as a professional association.\n\n(46) The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest\nwhich is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based\non the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be\nmanifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public\ninterest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian\npurposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in\nparticular in situations of natural and man-made disasters.\n\n(47) The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be\ndisclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental\nrights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of\ndata subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest could exist for example where\nthere is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where\nthe data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would\nneed careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the\ncollection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights\nof the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in\ncircumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that it is for the legislator toprovide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to\nthe processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly\nnecessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.\nThe processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate\ninterest.\n\n(48) Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a\nlegitimate interest in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes,\nincluding the processing of clients' or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal\ndata, within a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected.\n\n(49) The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring\nnetwork and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of\nconfidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity\nand confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or\naccessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emergency response teams (CERTs),\ncomputer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and\nservices and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller\nconcerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks\n\nand malicious code distribution and stopping \u2018denial of service\u2019 attacks and damage to computer and electronic\ncommunication systems.\n\n(50) The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected\nshould be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were\ninitially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is\nrequired. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the\nexercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the\ntasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing\nfor archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be\nconsidered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law\nfor the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain whether\na purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the\ncontroller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into\naccount, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context\nin which the personal data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on\ntheir relationship with the controller as to their further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the\nintended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and\nintended further processing operations.Where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes\na necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of\ngeneral public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the\ncompatibility of the purposes.

Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the\nrelevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or threats to public\nsecurity to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller.\nHowever, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should\nbe prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy.\n\n(155) Member State law or collective agreements, including \u2018works agreements\u2019, may provide for specific rules on the\nprocessing of employees' personal data in the employment context, in particular for the conditions under which\npersonal data in the employment context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the purposes\nof the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations laid down by\nlaw or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the\nworkplace, health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or\ncollective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the\n\nemployment relationship.\n\nDocuments\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nArticle 29 Working Party, Opinion 6/2014 on the Notion of Legitimate Interests of the Data Controller Under Article\n7 of Directive 95/46/EC (2014).\n\nEDPB, Assessing the Necessity of Measures That Limit the Fundamental Right to the Protection of Personal Data: A\nToolkit (2017).\n\nWP29, Opinion on data processing at work (2017).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines on Assessing the Proportionality of Measures That Limit the Fundamental Rights to Privacy and to\nthe Protection of Personal Data (2019).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 2/2019 on the Processing of Personal Data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the Context of the\nProvision of Online Services to Data Subjects (2019).Data Protection Commission of Ireland,  Guidance Note: Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data (2019).\n\nData Protection Commission (Ireland), Data Protection Considerations Relating to Receivership (2020).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020).\n\nEuropean Commission, Guidance on Apps supporting the fight against COVID 19 pandemic in relation to data\nprotection Brussels (2020).\n\nEDPB, Guidelines 02/2021 on Virtual Voice Assistants (2021).\n\nCase Law\n\nCJEC, Rechnungshof/\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk, C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 (2003).\n\nCJEC, Huber/Germany, C-524/06 (2008).\n\nCJEU, Scarlet Extended SA/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge des auteurs, compositeurs et \u00e9diteurs, C-70/10 (2011).\n\nCJEU, Google Spain SL/Agencia espa\u00f1ola de protecci\u00f3n de datos, C-131/12 (2014).\n\nECHR, Antovi\u0107 and Mirkovi\u0107 v.

As long as the categorisation enables targeting based on\n\nspecial category data, it does not matter how the category is labelled.EDPB, Guidelines 06/2020 on the interplay of the Second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR (2020).\n\nFinancial transactions can reveal sensitive information about individual data subject, including those related to special\n\ncategories of personal data. For example, political opinions and religious beliefs may be revealed by donations made to political\n\nparties or organisations, churches or parishes. Trade union membership may be revealed by the deduction of an annual\n\nmembership fee from a person\u2019s bank account. Personal data concerning health may be gathered from analysing medical bills\n\npaid by a data subject. Finally, information on certain purchases may reveal information concerning a person\u2019s sex life or\n\nsexual orientation.\n\nMoreover, through the sum of financial transactions, different kinds of behavioural patterns could be revealed, including\n\nspecial categories of personal data and additional services that are facilitated by account information services might rely on\n\nprofiling as defined by article 4 (4) of the GDPR. Therefore, the chances are considerable that a service provider processing\n\ninformation on financial transactions of data subjects also processes special categories of personal data.\n\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:\n\nRecitals\n\n(52) Derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when provided for in\n\nUnion or Member State law and subject to suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights, where it is\n\nin the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal data in the field of employment law, social protection law including\n\npensions and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious\n\nthreats to health. Such a derogation may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management of health-care\n\nservices, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and\n\nservices in the health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or\n\nstatistical purposes. A derogation should also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment,\n\nexercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.\n\n(53) Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes only where\n\nnecessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the\n\nmanagement of health or social care services and systems, including processing by the management and central national health\n\nauthorities of such data for the purpose of quality control, management information and the general national and local supervision of\n\nthe health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security,\n\nmonitoring and alert purposes, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical\n\npurposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in\n\nthe public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for harmonised conditions for the\n\nprocessing of special categories of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular where the processing of\n\nsuch data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union or\nMember State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of\n\nnatural persons.

Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and\n\nfreedoms of natural persons.

A derogation should also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the\nestablishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-\ncourt procedure.(53) Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related\npurposes only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in\nparticular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems, including processing by the\nmanagement and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control, management\ninformation and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity\nof health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes, or for archiving\npurposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or\nMember State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in the public\ninterest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for harmonised conditions for the\nprocessing of special categories of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular where\nthe processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation\nof professional secrecy. Union or Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as to\nprotect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons. Member States should be allowed to maintain\nor introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or\ndata concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow of personal data within the Union when those\nconditions apply to cross-border processing of such data.\n\n(54) The processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas\n\nof public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific\nmeasures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In that context, \u2018public health\u2019 should be\ninterpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council [11], namely\nall elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an\neffect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and universal access\nto, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data\nconcerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes\nby third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies.\n\n[11] Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on\nCommunity statistics on public health and health and safety at work (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 70). https://eur-\nlex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2008:354:TOC\n\n(55) Moreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims, laid\ndown by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially recognised religious associations, is carried out\non grounds of public interest.\n\n(56) Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires\nthat political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be\npermitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.Documents\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nArticle 29 Working Party, Opinion 2/2010 on behavioural advertising (2010):\n\nAny possible targeting of data subjects based on sensitive information opens the possibility of abuse.\nFurthermore, given the sensitivity of such information and the possible awkward situations which may arise if\nindividuals receive advertising that reveals, for example, sexual preferences or political activity,\noffering/using interest categories that would reveal sensitive data should be discouraged.\n\nIn this context, the only available legal ground that would legitimize the data processing would be explicit,\nseparate prior opt-in consent. The requirement for a separate, affirmative prior indication of the data\nsubjects\u2019 agreement means that in no case would an opt-out consent mechanism meet the requirement of the\nlaw. It also means that such consent could not be obtained through browser settings.

To\n\navoid information fatigue, this can be included within a layered privacy statement/ notice (see paragraph 35). In any case, the\n\nWP29 position is that information to the data subject should make it clear that they can obtain information on the balancing\n\ntest upon request. This is essential for effective transparency where data subjects have doubts as to whether the balancing test\n\nhas been carried out fairly or they wish to file a complaint with a supervisory authority.\n\n(e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nArticle 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):\n\nThe term \u201crecipient\u201d is defined in Article 4.9 as \u201ca natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which\n\nthe personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not\u201d [emphasis added]. As such, a recipient does not have to be a\n\nthird party. Therefore, other data controllers, joint controllers and processors to whom data is transferred or disclosed are\n\ncovered by the term \u201crecipient\u201d and information on such recipients should be provided in addition to information on third\n\nparty recipients. The actual (named) recipients of the personal data, or the categories of recipients, must be provided. In\n\naccordance with the principle of fairness, controllers must provide information on the recipients that is most meaningful for\n\ndata subjects. In practice, this will generally be the named recipients, so that data subjects know exactly who has their\n\npersonal data. If controllers opt to provide the categories of recipients, the information should be as specific as possible by\n\nindicating the type of recipient (i.e. by reference to the activities it carries out), the industry, sector and sub-sector and the\n\nlocation of the recipients.\n\n(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international\norganisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers\nreferred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or\nsuitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nArticle 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):\n\nThe relevant GDPR article permitting the transfer and the corresponding mechanism (e.g. adequacy decision under Article45/ binding corporate rules under Article 47/ standard data protection clauses under Article 46.2/ derogations and safeguards\n\nunder Article 49 etc.) should be specified. Information on where and how the relevant document may be accessed or obtained\n\nshould also be provided e.g. by providing a link to the mechanism used. In accordance with the principle of fairness, the\n\ninformation provided on transfers to third countries should be as meaningful as possible to data subjects; this will generally\n\nmean that the third countries be named.\n\n2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are\nobtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent\nprocessing:\n\nRecitals\n\n(61) The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him or her at the\n\ntime of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source, within a reasonable period,\n\ndepending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject\n\nshould be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal\n\ndata for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further\n\nprocessing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be\n\nprovided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided.\n\n(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine\nthat period;\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nArticle 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016):\n\nThis is linked to the data minimisation requirement in Article 5.1(c) and storage limitation requirement in Article 5.1(e). The\n\nstorage period (or criteria to determine it) may be dictated by factors such as statutory requirements or industry guidelines but\n\nshould be phrased in a way that allows the data subject to assess, on the basis of his or her own situation, what the retention\n\nperiod will be for specific data/ purposes. It is not sufficient for the data controller to generically state that personal data will\n\nbe kept as long as necessary for the legitimate purposes of the processing.

Where personal data can be legitimately\ndisclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the\nrecipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were\ncollected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other\npurpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data\nsubject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided.\n\n(62) However, it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already\npossesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law or\nwhere the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate\neffort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in the public\ninterest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of data subjects,\nthe age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration.\n\n(63) A data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her,\nand to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the\nprocessing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for example the\n\ndata in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating\nphysicians and any treatment or interventions provided. Every data subject should therefore have the right to know\nand obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed, where\npossible the period for which the personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in\nany automatic personal data processing and, at least when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing.\nWhere possible, the controller should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide the\ndata subject with direct access to his or her personal data.

However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data\nsubject.

Right to rectification\n\nAuthor\n\nLouis-Philippe Gratton\n\n  PhD, LLM\n\n  Privacy Expert\n\nExpert commentary\n\nThe Council of Europe recommended, in 1973, that \u201cinaccurate information\u201d\nshould be corrected in the context of data compiled in electronic data banks\n(Resolution on the Protection of the Privacy of Individuals vis-a-vis Electronic\nData Banks in the Private Sector). So, it is not surprising that the European\nUnion 2016 General Data Protection Regulation provides for a \u201cright to\nrectification\u201d. The surprise comes from the absence of guidance regarding\nthe rights and responsibilities related to the exercise of that right.\n\nA person may ask the controller to rectify \u201cinaccurate personal data\u201d\nconcerning him or her. The controller has the obligation to proceed to that\nrectification \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d and free of charge (recital 59). The right\nextends to complete incomplete data, a person being allowed to produce a\nsupplementary statement to this end. In that event, the controller can accept\nor refuse the modification depending on the purposes of the processing.\n\nThe GDPR does not define what are \u201cinaccurate\u201d personal data, but the\nto\nCourt of Justice of the European Union excludes that\n\nthe right\n\nrectification extends to allowing a person to correct an incorrect answer to an\nexam (Nowak). It does not mean that a person cannot ask to rectify an\nanswer or an examiner\u2019s comment regarding the exam that does not\naccurately reflect the original answer of the candidate. It can happen if, for\nexample, copies were mixed up and another candidate\u2019s answers were\nascribed to the candidate concerned (Nowak).\n\nThe possibility to complete or rectify inaccurate or incomplete information\ncan also be invoked in the context of profiling, i.e. when a company\nestablishes profiles of employees or users for different reasons (advertising,\nmarketing, work performance, and so on). It is the case where it uses\npersonal data, usually through automated processing, to make decisions\nconcerning them or to analyze or predict their personal preferences,\nbehaviors or attitudes [article 4 (4) and recital 24].A \u201cprofiled\u201d person may use her/his right of access (article 15) to learn what\ninformation was used to create the profile and the content of the profile\nitself. The \u201cright to rectification\u201d would allow her/him to amend, change or\nupdate any inaccuracies discovered (Guidelines on Automated individual\ndecision-making and Profiling). A person might have been included in a\ncategory, for example, that does not correspond to her/his ability to perform\na task at work or is irrelevant to her/his health condition. The person may\nchallenge the accuracy of the information used and the end result, that is to\nsay, the profile itself (Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making\nand Profiling).\n\nData Subject Request Letter Sample\n\nAuthor\n\nExpert commentary\n\nConcern: Request to rectify inaccurate personal data\n\nDear Madam, Dear Sir,\n\nYou have data concerning me that are inaccurate.\n\nMore specifically, the following data are incorrect:\n\n[My name | My email address | My personal address | My phone number |\netc.]\n\nPursuant to Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),\nplease correct the data as follows:\n\n[Accurate information]\n\nThank you for confirming as soon as possible that you have made the\nrectification, and in any event within one month of the receipt of my request,\naccording to Article 12(3) of the GDPR.\n\nPlease, notify this request for rectification to every recipient to whom you\nhave disclosed my personal data, as provided for by Article 19 of the GDPR.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLouis-Philippe Gratton\n\n  PhD, LLM\n\n  Privacy Expert[Your name]\n\nData Subject Request Letter Sample\n\nAuthor\n\nExpert commentary\n\nLouis-Philippe Gratton\n\n  PhD, LLM\n\n  Privacy Expert\n\nConcern: Request to rectify incomplete personal data\n\nDear Madam, Dear Sir,\n\nYou have data concerning me that are incomplete.\n\nMore specifically, the following data have to be completed:\n\n[My name | My email address | My personal address | My phone number |\netc.]\n\nPursuant to Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),\nplease complete the data as follows:\n\n[Complete information]\n\nThank you for confirming as soon as possible that you have made the\nrectification, and in any event within one month of the receipt of my request,\naccording to Article 12(3) of the GDPR.\n\nPlease, notify this request for rectification to every recipient to whom you\nhave disclosed my personal data, as provided for by Article 19 of the GDPR.\n\nSincerely,\n\nData Subject\n\nExpert commentary\n\nAuthorSiarhei Varankevich\n\n  CIPP/E, CIPM, CIPT, MBA, FIP\n\n  Co-Founder & CEO of Data\nPrivacy Office LLC.

Right to restriction of processing\n\nExpert commentary\n\nThe right to restriction of processing is one of the eight rights granted by the\nGDPR, but it is not the easiest one to understand at first glance. It can be\nsummed up as an obligation on behalf of the controller to retain data, but\nthey can neither be processed in any other manner nor modified.\n\nAuthor\n\nLouis-Philippe Gratton\n\n  PhD, LLM\n\n  Privacy Expert\n\nThe right is exercised in cases where there is no clear indication of whether\npersonal data will be deleted on a precise legal ground or when. It is\nespecially useful when the right to erasure (article 17) cannot be invoked\nimmediately, if the organization has a legal obligation to retain the data, for\nexample.\n\nA person has a limited right to restrict the processing of her/his data under\nfour scenarios:\n\nif the accuracy of the concerned data is challenged;\n\nif the processing of the data was unlawful but the person opposed to\ntheir deleting;\n\nif the data are needed to establish, exercise or fight a legal claim; or\n\nif a person exercised her/his right to object (article 21) but the\ncontroller claimed \u201ccompelling legitimate\u201d grounds for the processing.\n\nParagraph 2 of the provision entails the consequences of exercising one\u2019s\nright to restriction of processing. Aside from storage, the personal data\ncannot be processed anymore except i) with the consent of the person\nconcerned; ii) in actions related to a legal claim; iii) for the protection of the\nrights of other persons (recital 73); or iv) if important public interests are\ninvolved (recital 73).\n\nThe GDPR text does not specify how to restrict the processing of personal\ndata in cases where a person asks to, but recital 67 suggests a non-exhaustive\nlist of methods to achieve that goal. The data can be moved temporarily to\nanother processing system, access to specific data can be restricted or datacan be temporarily unpublished from a website. Technical means must\nensure that data are not processed or changed where automated filing\nsystems are concerned. The restrictions should be clearly mentioned\nwhatever method is preferred (recital 67).\n\nThe duration of the restriction is also unclear. The European legal texts\nmention that data must not be processed \u201cfor a period enabling the controller\nto verify [their] accuracy\u201d, for example, or \u201cpending the verification\u201d whether\nexists a legitimate ground overriding a person\u2019s objection to processing. The\ntime during which data cannot be processed will be a question of facts or of\nindividual situations.

Notification obligation regarding\n\nrectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing\n\nAuthor\n\nLouis-Philippe Gratton\n\n  PhD, LLM\n\n  Privacy Expert\n\nExpert commentary\n\nArticle 19 includes a notification obligation, which should not be confused\nwith the specific personal data breach notification obligation (article 33). It\nis a mechanism that gives full effect to other provisions of the General Data\nProtection Regulation, ensuring that third parties are informed about actions\ntaken by the controller regarding personal data (recital 66).\n\nAfter a person has exercised her/his right to rectification (article 16),\nerasure (article 17) or restriction of processing (article 18), the controller\nmust inform all parties (\u201crecipients\u201d) to whom s/he has disclosed data. The\nprovision should be read as referring to all forms of communication of\npersonal data, like \u201cdisclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise\nmaking available\u201d [article 4 (2)]. The recipient identified in the text of the\nprovision comprises natural or legal persons, public authorities, agencies or\nbodies [article 4 (9)]. They are not limited to external parties, they\nencompass in-house persons, departments or services.\n\nThere is a limit to the general obligation imposed on the controller to inform\n\nrecipients: her/his responsibility ends where it proves impossible to do so or\nit involves \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d on her/his part. Articles 14 (5) b) and 34\n(3) c) of the GDPR uses the same wording (\u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d), but\nthe Court of Justice of the European Union did not interpret the meaning of\nthe expression yet.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales clarified similar\nwording in the former domestic Data Protection Act 1998 [article 8(2)(a)]\nbefore the entry into force of the GDPR. The case involved a data access\nrequest and the \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d exception to refuse to comply with\nthe demand. The judge left it to an appreciation of facts of each particular\ncase to balance the effort involved in finding and supplying the information\nagainst the potential benefit it might bring to the person requesting data\n(Dawson-Damer v. Taylor Wessing LLP).The \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d exception of article 19 should not be read as a\nway to get around the provisions of the GDPR. It should not be invoked, for\nexample, if the \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d results of the number of recipients\nto whom the controller disclosed personal data. The burden of proving that\nthe request would involve \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d should rest on the\ncontroller\u2019s shoulders. S/he should demonstrate that s/he took \u201creasonable\nsteps\u201d to inform recipients of personal data, \u201ctaking into account available\ntechnology and the means available\u201d (recital 66).\n\nThe controller should not be allowed to invoke inadequate information\nmanagement systems or poor practices to refuse to inform recipients, as they\ncan be viewed as a breach of her/his obligations under the GDPR to\nimplement data protection by design and by default (article 25).\n\nThe goal of the provision may be evaded nonetheless by the recipient as s/he\nis formerly under no legal obligation to use the controller\u2019s information. The\ndrafters of the European regulation seem to have ignored this scenario,\n\nletting recipients decide whether or not they will give effect to the request of\nthe controller.\n\nAs the concerned person may ask to be informed about the identity of the\nrecipients, s/he may have to exercise her/his rights to rectification, erasure or\nrestriction of processing by contacting directly each identified recipient. It\nwould be a shift in the notification obligation from the controller to the data\nsubject, although the latter has not decided to share her/his information with\nother recipients.\n\nCase Law\n\nGuidelines & Case Law\n\nEngland and Wales Court of Appeal (EWCA), Dawson-Damer v.

Source: EUR-lex.Related information Article 20. Right to data portability\n\nAuthor\n\nLouis-Philippe Gratton\n\n  PhD, LLM\n\n  Privacy Expert\n\nExpert commentary\n\nThe right to data portability is presented primarily as a way to support \u201cuser\nchoice, user control, and user empowerment\u201d (Guidelines on the Right to Data\nPortability), as it aims at reinforcing an individual\u2019s control over her/his\npersonal information (recital 68). Data portability allows users to receive a\ncopy of their personal data and can be seen in that sense as an extension of\nthe right of access (article 15). It can also help them to switch services\nwithout losing their data, enabling users to transfer their information from\none service to a potentially better one.\n\nArticle 20 provides for a general right to data portability, which may be\ndecomposed into two separate rights: i) a right to receive one\u2019s personal data\n\u201cin a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format\u201d; and ii) a\nright to transmit the received data without interference. Portability can be\ninvoked if the following conditions are respected:\n\ndata has been collected based on consent [article 6 (1) (a) or 9 (2) (a)\n] or on a contract [article 6 (1) (b)]; and\n\nthey were processed by automated means, which excludes most\n\npaper files (Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability).\n\nWhat are the data concerned by the portability right? Article 20 says it is the\ndata \u201cprovided\u201d by a person. The Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability\nspecifies that this word must be interpreted broadly. It recommends that data\nderived from the activities of users (logs, browsing history, search activities,\nlocation, and so on) should be treated as data \u201cprovided\u201d by a user.\nTherefore,\nthe right covers not only the data actively and directly\nvolunteered by users, but also those generated by their activity while using\nthe application, device or service in question. The official interpretation\nextends the reach of the right to data portability beyond the text of the article\nitself and the legislative intent of the Council and the Parliament, some\ncritics say.within\n\nthe\n\nData concerned by the provision are only \u201cpersonal\ndata\u201d,\nmeaning of article 4 (1), which excludes anonymous data and data that are\nnot related to a user (Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability). It should\nalso be emphasized that the right to data portability must be regarded in the\ncontext of the General Data Protection Regulation. It concerns \u201cpersonal\ndata\u201d and not data in general. A playlist from a streaming service, for\nexample, contains the listening preferences of a user and is thus included in\nthe scope of the right but the songs themselves are not.\n\nThe right to data portability cannot, as a rule, affect other people\u2019s rights\n(recital 68). The guarantee aims at avoiding the processing of third parties\u2019\npersonal data without a legal basis while allowing a person to exercise her/his\nright to data portability. However, there are limits to this exception. If, for\nexample, a person requests his/her calling data, the data might includes third\nparties\u2019 information related to incoming and outgoing calls (like phone\nnumbers). These data should be considered for the portability right as they\nalso concern the person who requests the data (Guidelines on the Right to\n\nData Portability). One can argue that the transfer does not affect third\nparties\u2019 rights more than the initial processing, explaining the existence of\nthis limit to safeguarding the rights and freedoms of others.\n\nArticle 20 prescribes that data should be communicated \u201cin a structured,\ncommonly used and machine-readable format\u201d, but falls short of defining\nprecisely the outline of these requirements. A machine-readable format is\ndefined in a European directive as a format \u201cthat is structured in such a way\nthat software applications can easily identify, recognise and extract specific\ndata from it\u201d (Directive 2013/37/EU).\n\n\u201cStructured\u201d could refer to an obligation to organize the information in such\na way that it can be easily accessible to users. They should not have to dig\ninto the document or file provided to find the expected data. Information\nshould be classified or categorized systematically in a comprehensible\nmanner and they should be offered \u201cin a format which supports re-use\u201d\n(Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability).\n\nThe expression \u201ccommonly used\u201d, read in conjunction with recital 68, seems\nto refer to the concept of \u201cinteroperability\u201d. Indeed, recital 68 completes the\ntext of the article adding a requirement that data should be made available in\nan \u201cinteroperable\u201d format. It states that \u201ccontrollers should be encouraged to\ndevelop interoperable formats that enable data portability\u201d, but it does not go\nas far as requesting that controllers adopt or maintain technically compatibleprocessing systems.\n\nEven if it was adopted as one of the eight rights guaranteed by the GDPR,\nthe right to data portability may be looked at first and foremost as a\nregulatory tool to stimulate competition and innovation in the European\ninternal market. It may be potentially thought of as an economic incentive to\npromote the free flow of information and competitiveness between service\nproviders.\n\nThe right to transmit received data to another controller depends almost\nsolely on innovation. Could the requirement of being able to transfer data\n\u201cwithout hindrance\u201d be read as an obligation to develop such systems? The\nGuidelines on the Right\nto Data Portability specify that \u201chindrance\u201d\ncomprehends \u201clegal, technical or financial obstacles\u201d if they refrain or slow\ndown access, transmission or reuse of data. The Guidelines go as far as\nclassifying the lack of interoperability as an example of such hindrance. It\nshould be mentioned though that article 20 poses one condition to the\nshould be mentioned though that article 20 poses one condition to the\n\nexercise of the right to transfer data: it must be technically feasible.\nexercise of the right to transfer data: it must be technically feasible.\n\nData portability poses a challenge to information technology companies as\nData portability poses a challenge to information technology companies as\nthey are generally not ready technically to answer such a demand.
